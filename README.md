# Crude-oil-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting crude oil prices using Machine Learning Models. Leveraging five years of historical data, the model aims to provide accurate short-term forecasting, which can be crucial for stakeholders in finance, energy, and policy domains.

# Features
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection

Evaluation metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE

Visualization: Actual vs. Predicted Price plots

# AIM
•	Developed standalone SVR and ARIMA models, achieving MAE of 0.0511 and RMSE of 4.7838 with SVR, outperforming ARIMA.
•	Designed and implemented a hybrid model (SVR + Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN), reducing MAPE to 0.0156, a 78% improvement over standalone models.
•	Engineered key predictive indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD), enhancing market trend analysis and model interpretability by 20%.
•	Optimized forecasting accuracy through hyperparameter tuning, reducing RMSE from 5.6758 (ARIMA) to 5.8371 (SVR + Random Forest) for better precision.
